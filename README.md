# Visual_AI

## Final Year TY Project

### An Android App developed to aid the visually challenged to detect objects in front of them and let them know about it with the help of Text-to-Speech available on most devices.

* Built using TensorFlow as the Machine Learning Framework.
* Optimised for inference on the device itself.
* Works completely offline.

### Things learnt
* How machine learning works, the various terms used, and how to tweak algorithms for optimisation for mobile platform.
* Various Machine Learning technologies available like TensorFlow, Keras, Theano; and how they are better than the other
* Various Pre-trained models available by Google like MobileNet, Resnet; their advantages and disadvantages over one another.
* Android Development and the "correct way to do things" with a top-down approach at learning through online documentation.
